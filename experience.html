            <p>After finishing high school in 2001, I went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating in 2011 and majoring in History, while working part time in a retail setting.  The critical thinking and organization skills I obtained while doing course work has proven to be very valuable to myself when approaching work organization and how I deal with clients in a professional setting.</p>

            <h2>Work History</h2>
            <p>Working in many fields has taught me that any skill, no matter how specific to a job it may seem, can be translated and used in other applications.</p>
            <p>Work in customer service has allowed me to develop excellent verbal and non-verbal communication and an ability to deal with clients with a wide range of needs.</p>
            <p>Work done in a warehouse settings, specifically shipping and receiving, has forced me to adapt to short timelines and meet deadlines while staying organized and focused on priotity goals.</p>
